# Session: Period Tracking Sales Channel - 2026-02-25

## Original Story/Requirements

**User Request:**
```
PeriodTrackingReport will provide a total for the calendar date range selected
(business date for MOP and Delivery).
Same structure as DailyTrackingSalesChannel but for a date range.
```

**Additional Context:**
- Same 3 channels as DailyTrackingSalesChannel: MOP, Delivery, McCafe
- MOP and Delivery aggregate across BusDate BETWEEN StartDate AND EndDate
- McCafe aggregates across CalendarDate BETWEEN StartDate AND EndDate
- Output structure identical to daily version

---

## Status

- [/] In Development — query written and committed (WIP), pending sandbox verification
- [/] Testing extra NULL guards (TenderTypeId, OperationId, SWCCashDrawerId IS NULL) in test-mccafe.sql — will propagate to query.sql once confirmed

**Current step**: NULL guards added to test-mccafe.sql. Pending user sandbox confirmation before propagating to query.sql and period query.sql.

## Key Differences from DailyTrackingSalesChannel

| | Daily | Period |
|-|-------|--------|
| Date params | `Date` (single) | `StartDate` + `EndDate` (range) |
| Period CTE | `TargetPeriod` (single row) | `TargetPeriods` (all periods in range) |
| MOP/Delivery filter | `BusDate = @Date` | `BusDate BETWEEN @StartDate AND @EndDate` |
| McCafe filter | `CalendarDate = @Date` | `CalendarDate BETWEEN @StartDate AND @EndDate` |
| test-find-valid-dates | Groups by day | Groups by week |

---

## Open Questions / For Next Session

- Sandbox verification — run `test-find-valid-dates.sql` to find a valid week, then `test-ssms.sql`
- Confirm totals match expected values from the report UI
