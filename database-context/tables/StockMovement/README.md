# Table: StockMovement

**OutSystems Entity**: StockMovement
**Module**: Stock (Stock_CS)
**Purpose**: Parent record for all stock movements — deliveries, transfers, and adjustments
**Last Updated**: 2026-03-31

## Overview

`StockMovement` is the parent table for all stock movement transactions. Each row represents a single movement event (delivery, transfer, or adjustment). The movement type determines which extension table holds additional details (e.g., `Transfer` for transfer-type movements). Line items are stored in `StockMovementLine`.

For **transfers specifically**:
- `DeliverySiteId` = the **receiving** site
- `Date` is **null** until the transfer is approved by the receiving store
- `NetAmount`, `TaxAmount`, `GrossAmount` are calculated and written **on approval**

## Common Query Patterns

### Get Transfers for a Site (as sender or receiver)
```sql
SELECT sm.*, t.*
FROM {StockMovement} sm
INNER JOIN {Transfer} t ON t.StockMovementId = sm.Id
WHERE sm.MovementTypeId = 2
  AND (sm.DeliverySiteId = @SiteId OR t.FromSiteId = @SiteId)
```

### Get Movement with Line Count and Totals
```sql
SELECT
    sm.Id,
    sm.Date,
    COUNT(sml.Id) AS LineCount,
    SUM(sml.NetAmount) AS TotalNetAmount
FROM {StockMovement} sm
INNER JOIN {StockMovementLine} sml ON sml.StockMovementId = sm.Id
WHERE sm.MovementTypeId = 2
GROUP BY sm.Id, sm.Date
```

## Notes for OutSystems

- Use `{StockMovement}` in Advanced SQL
- `MovementTypeId = 2` for transfers
- `Date` is null for pending transfers — filter accordingly
- `DeliverySiteId` is the **receiving** site for transfers (not the sender)
